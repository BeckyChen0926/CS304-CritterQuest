Directions:
You can create a new account or log in with the sample username and password. 
Just type in the username and password and click either login or register. 
Clicking the reset button will clear the entered username and password. It will take a while to login, just wait.
After logging in or registering it will take you to your profile page with your information. 
You can edit the about me info by clicking the "Edit Profile" button. 
You can just type your new about me into the form, and clicking update will update your information and take you back to your profile page. You will also see the posts you have posted on the right side of your profile page.

The nav bar on top has a link to the timeline. Clicking it will take you to a timeline of all the posts in the database in reverse chronological order. You are able to click the like button to like the post.

The nav bar also has a link to Post a Sighting. Clicking this will take you to the post form where you select the type of animal you saw from a dropdown bar (or, if you want to most an animal that is not in the list, select “I will enter a new animal” and type your animal in the box to the right), type the location where you saw it, upload your image, and then write a caption for the post. 
Clicking the “Post my animal sighting!” button will redirect you to the timeline where your upload will appear.

There is also a search tab on the nav bar that will take you to a search form, where you can search by location or animals.
Search "dog" (exists) and "swan" (does not exist).

Finally, the nav bar contains the Logout link which takes you back to the Login/Register page.
